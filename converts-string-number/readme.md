# String-to-Int Conversion

## About Problem for Live Coding

Given a String of digits (and possibly signs) such as "123", write a routine int stringToInteger( String s ) that converts the string to an integer, without using the built in Javascript functions that would do this. The code should handle reasonable edge and error conditions gracefully. (You can rely on the input being in base-10 representation - no need to worry about hex, octal, or binary input.)
